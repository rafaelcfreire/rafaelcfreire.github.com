Hi everybody,

This is the post that I always thought to write. Actually, it should have been the first material of the blog as a kind of presenting myself but as I was reading some titles during that time I decided to finish them before write it. This text is a kind of walkthrough in my career once I believe that the books you read directly influences the quality and the maturity level of the professional. As I mentioned before I usually read a lot of books but only achieve the end of those that really arouse my curiosity and interest, there are a lot of titles that I just start and some that I don't think I am ready in terms of knowledge or inspiration to get the details so, I postpone the read and strangely that action works for me because some of the best titles I ever read were left aside to read in a later opportunity sometime.

I don't like list anything in order of relevance because it is a very subtle concept, even being a personal list it is hard to give a cardinal order for my favorite books (I have already tried do it with my vinyl records and CDs but I always forget one that cannot be missing), I will try to put them in a chronological way, from the first to the last I've read to give an idea of sequence so, let's start:

Clearly focused to starters, the Java Deitel is an awesome resource that brings an naive example of an ATM and its evolution to a java application using Swing GUI, network API, Multithreading and the old fashioned JDBC. Even the book being really large, it is not necessary fatinguing to read althought sometimes it goes really deeper in some examples. The use of [UML](http://www.uml.org/) to illustrate the examples is perfect to enhance the reader understanding in a visual approach. Personally, even years later from my first contact with this reading I think it still relevant for entry level developers who intend to enter the Object Oriented world and the Java language

### Head First Design Patterns
One of the first books that I was suggested to read when starting programming was the <cite>[Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://books.google.com.br/books/about/Design_Patterns.html?id=6oHuKQe3TjQC&redir_esc=y)</cite> written by the gang of four(Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides). Every experienced software developer . I remember that this book was
