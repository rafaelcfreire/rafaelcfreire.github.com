Hi there,

As I mentioned in a previous post, currently I am studying <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org" target="_blank">Scala language</a> motivated by attending to <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun">Functional Programming Principles in Scala</a> where I could understand some principles of FP that I already wrote about [here](http://rafaelcfreire.github.io/2014/10/30/Where-to-start-with-functional-programming/). In my readings about FP the term Reactive Programming were always recurrent in Scala docs or in other web resources. But what is it? The main resource related to the subject is the [Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org) where there are some parts that defines the aim of Reactive Programming like "These systems are more robust, more resilient, more flexible and better positioned to meet modern demands.", okay, these adjectives are meaningless if we don't understand in depth the 4 principles of reactive systems according the above manifesto, that are: 

- Message Driven: Based in asynchronous communication through messages, the <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessagingComponentsIntro.html" target="_blank">Message Driven Communication</a> lies on the principle of loose coupling that is essentially important for modern applications. 
- Elastic:
- Resilient:
- Responsive:
