Hello everyone, 

One important part of the web developer's job nowadays is assure the responsiveness of the pages that he is creating. It is impossible to start a project which <a href="http://speckyboy.com/2013/01/17/the-evolution-of-responsive-web-design-responsivity-analysis/">responsivity analysis</a> is not a mandatory requirement, the therm <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2012/03/mobile-first-what-does-it-mean.php">Mobile First</a> is already exhausted discussed <a href="http://www.webinsation.com/why-should-i-design-for-mobile-first/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.wearejh.com/design/benefits-of-a-mobile-first-approach/">here</a> by instance.
But even responsive development being not exactly a new trend, responsiveness test still being a <a href="http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view/656679/pitfall-o.gif" target="_blank">challenging</a> task once is impossible for a developer (even for a company) to have all devices to perform his tests and simulate specific scenarios for each case.
In this article I'll show the tools I normally use (does not mean that these are the best, just that I am familiar with). In my opinion, the most important factor to decide a tool amongst others is how much productive you are with it, in my case includes avoid repetitive work, prevents you wasting too much time to find their resources and to understand how it works and obviously, give a decent emulation of the device you're aiming to.

I classified the tools in two sections, first those that you can use during the development time, that is, tools embedded in browsers toward get a notion of your design while it is being created, the second part consists of tools to check the overall result of your work after it has been deployed. Things like layouts, font-sizes, distance and menus are extremely sensibles for differents environments so it is really worth to exhastly test them all in at least the most common environments.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

Major moderns browsers have their ours developer tools. Although it is a embedded feature, they are extremely mature with all that is needed to develop a page fully responsive together with <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp" target="_blank">Media Queries</a>
